Modern exp

- Modern team sites
- Modern list and library experiences
- Modern pages 

Modern experiences are gradually released to SharePoint Online and you can control how they are taken into use from tenant or site level. If you have a lot of existing important customizations, you can defer taking new experiences into use until needed customizations scenarios can be enabled with them as well. 

We recommend taking following process for adopting the modern experiences depending on the needed customizations.

1. Readiness
    - Analyze
2. Assess
    - feature
3. Solution planning
    - feature
4. Develop and test the new needed capabilities 
5. Deploy your new solution

Here are the key scenarios currently supported for the modern experiences. We will be updating the list of supported scenarios gradually when new capabilities are being introduced in SharePoint Online.

Existing collaborations sites cannot at least currently converted to modern team sites with associated Office 365 group. You can however start using modern experiences in the classic collaboration sites as well by enabling the new capabilities in the tenant level and then modify the sites based on the functional requirements. 

Modern lists and library usage can be controlled in both tenant and in list/library level. You can find more details on the avaialble options from following support article.

You can also start using modern pages in classic SharePoint sites and change the welcome page to be a modern page.
